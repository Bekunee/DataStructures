# Programming Assignment 5. AVLTree

### Attributes
* Type: Individual work (you cannot collaborate with other students)
* Due date: 9:00 PM, Tue 20 June 2023 KST
* Rules: Only the C/C++ programming language reference, the earlier lab results, and the main textbook are allowed for your reference in doinig this homework. You are not allowed to see existing source code and to use other programming assistant tools; You must write down all source code by yourself.

### Description

You are asked to accomplish the following three tasks for implementing AVL Tree in C++:

1. Complete ``void AVLTree::restructure (Key k)``

2. Complete ``bool AVLTree::erase (Key k)`` 

This function eliminates an element with key ``k`` from the binary search tree if exists. If successed, the function return ``true``. Otherwise, return ``false``.

3. Update the ``main`` function to test ``bool AVLTree::erase (Key k)``

Revise ``main`` to demonstrate that your implementation of the ``remove`` function works correctly. The revised ``main`` function is expected to test various cases of the ``erase`` behaviors comprehensively.

### Submission instruction

Submit the resulting source code file to HDLMS by the submission deadline. No late submission will be accepted.
Your results will be evaluated by test cases, and also you may take in-person interview if needed.
